# Alpha DAO Ambassador Application

[**Apply here**](https://ambassador.alphadao.money)

We are looking for talented and passionate individuals to join our Ambassador Program.  As an AlphaDAO Ambassador, you would represent our community in your local area, and your duties would likely include organizing or helping local meet-ups and events, promoting our project, and attracting people from your local area to join our community.
 
Generally, you will be expected to be one of the most active community members, help others, and assist with brainstorming new ideas on how we can improve our project.

Ambassadors are also often tasked with helping our overall marketing and PR efforts, and they are expected to maintain a good reputation so that they would not stain the name of our project.
